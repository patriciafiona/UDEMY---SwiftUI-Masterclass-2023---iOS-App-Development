In this SwiftUI tutorial, we will develop a task manager iOS application with Core Data integration. This is not a project with a boring user interface. This iOS and iPadOS application provides a personal touch and feel.

iOS app development
Learn how to integrate Core Data with SwiftUI

Apple's Core Data framework helps developers to manage and interact with data on a persistent store. It works on iPhone, iPad, Mac computer, or even Apple Watch.

When we start from a brand new project, the easiest way to use the Core Data framework is by enabling the Core Data option on the setup screen. By doing that Xcode will generate all the required file templates with code and the managed object model for us.

This Xcode 12's new Core Data template comes with the SwiftUI app life cycle integration and the required Core Data Model. This is why it is worth knowing how to get started with this new template and how to create a working application.
