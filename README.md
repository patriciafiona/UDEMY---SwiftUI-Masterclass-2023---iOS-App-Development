In this tutorial, youâ€™ll write your very first Core Data application with SwiftUI in Xcode. Youâ€™ll see how easy it is to get started with all the resources provided in Xcode, from using the starter code templates to the Data Model editor.

## Without further ado, let's have some fun and build this outstanding Todo app with SwiftUI!

### What is Core Data?

Core Data is a framework that you use to manage the model layer objects in your application. It provides generalized and automated solutions to common tasks associated with object life cycle and object graph management, including persistence.

### What is Alternate iOS App Icon?

Learn how to dynamically change app icons in your iOS apps. Every app needs a beautiful and memorable icon that attracts attention in the App Store and stands out on the Home screen. Your icon is the first opportunity to communicate, at a glance, your appâ€™s purpose. It also appears throughout the system, such as in Settings and search results.

App customization is a feature that evokes a personal connection and enhances user experience. If it provides value in your app, you can let people select an alternate app icon from a set of predefined icons that are embedded within your app.
