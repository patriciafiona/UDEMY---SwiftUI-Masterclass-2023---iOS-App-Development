Onboarding screen with SwiftUI 2.0
SwiftUI offers new features, improved performance, and the power to do, even more, all while maintaining a stable API that makes it easy to bring your existing SwiftUI code forward into Xcode 12.

SwiftUI 2.0 is shipped with a brand new life cycle management API for apps built with SwiftUI let us write our entire app in SwiftUI and share even more code across all Apple platforms. It's providing faster performance, better diagnostics, and access to new controls.

One of the main learning objectives is to create a fully-featured iOS Onboarding screen with the new Page Tab View capability provided by the updated SwiftUI 2.0.

Users if they want, now they can restart the application by toggle the switch in the Settings screen. That way the app starts the onboarding process and we will see the welcome screen again.

### SETTINGS
