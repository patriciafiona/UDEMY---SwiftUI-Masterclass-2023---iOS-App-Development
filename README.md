What we â€˜re going to do in this SwiftUI tutorial? We will build a gorgeous iOS 13 and iPadOS app with a Tinder-like user interface design. Since swipe motion is quite a popular mobile UI pattern nowadays. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re going to dive into gestures with SwiftUI in this section. The app presents users with a pile of Honeymoon destination cards and allows them to use the swipe gesture to like or dislike a card.

In this tutorial, weâ€™re going to develop an awesome iOS/iPadOS app with SwiftUI drag gestures in Xcode. This could be a great portfolio app that you can show up with confidence in your job interview.
