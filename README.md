Discover how to incorporate alternate app icons into your SwiftUI app, allowing users to select their preferred icon. This feature empowers users to personalize their home screen with a selection of app icons which gives it a distinct style.

## Learning Scope

What will you learn and what are the main objectives of this SwiftUI project?
- [x] How to build a card layout.
- [x] How to use reusable components.
- [x] How to use gradient animation.
- [x] How to create light and dark mode.

 </p>
 
In this SwiftUI tutorial, weâ€™ll explore various layout containers like horizontal and vertical stacks, as well as the ZStack container. By the end, you'll have a complete understanding of how to create intricate layout designs.

### B. Alternate App Icons

 </p>
 
Learn how to add alternate app icons to your app, and it lets people choose which icon to display. An alternative icon could even be a light or dark mode version of the original icon or a collection of completely different styles.

### C. Gradient and Motion Animation

 </p>
 
We will learn how to animate a Linear Gradient fill using its starting and ending point. But not only that, we will develop a more complex motion animation by scaling and moving many circle shapes with various timing in a masked SwiftUI shape.

### D. SF Symbols

 </p>
 
With over 5000+ icons, SF Symbols is a library of iconography designed to integrate seamlessly with San Francisco, the system font for Apple platforms. New rendering modes provide greater control over how color is applied to symbols. Besides the standard Single color rendering, there is a Hierarchical rendering, a Palette rendering, and a Multicolor rendering.

### E. iPhone and iPad App Icon
 <p align="center">

 </p>
 
App Icon makes the first impression on the users' mobile devices. We could not take shortcuts without it if we wanted to upload our application to Apple's App Store.
